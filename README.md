# Simon-Game-Project

How the Simon Game Works.

First, the game shows the first colour in the sequence (green).
The user clicks on the green button.

Next, the game shows the next colour (red).
The user has to remember the sequence is green, red and so on and so forth.

If the user messed up the sequence, then the game ends.
